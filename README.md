# FootballOS

## Overview
`FootballOS` is a SwiftUI football statistics application for [visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/visionos/), developed as a learning project to explore new VisionOS features. This app provides up-to-date stats from major football leagues.

## Features
- **Data from Top Competitions**: Get stats from leagues like EPL, Serie A, La Liga, Bundesliga, and more.
- **Season Standings**: View standings from the latest and past three seasons.
- **Top Scorers**: Discover top scorers from recent seasons.

## Learning Journey
This app was built as part of my journey to learn new VisionOS functionalities. Following a tutorial by Alfian Losari, `FootballOS` allowed me to gain hands-on experience with the latest Apple development kits and SwiftUI.

## Data Source
Data is sourced from [Football-Data.org API](https://www.football-data.org/).
